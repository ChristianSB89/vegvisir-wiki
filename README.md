# About this project

This is a site I'm making about a fictional world where stories are in the making.
Main inspiration is steampunk with some twists.

## First and foremost

For the time being I'm not thinking design yet, just using a lot of borders to do some quick and easy layout planning.

##### The content

The stories are not written yet. This site will act as a memory bank where ideas and background stories will be stored.
Might even call this a reference site for the writer.

## Plans for this page

As for now, there will not be much featured on this site. For now I will be setting up basic layouts and do a lot of background stuff, but eventually it will be a website that is constantly updated.
Hopefully this will be a full-fledged encyclopedia about this fantasy universe.
